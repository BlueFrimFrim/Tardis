    > Added 'receive_avr.cpp' to project. There is no '.h' file because all the functions are declared
        in 'tardis.h'. 

        Basically each Arduino in the tardis system will have it's own 'main_task()' and 'xxx_setup()'.
        This way you will just have to call the setup function and the main_task function.

    > This means getting rid of all the structs. It's too complicated right now. Therefor this it is
        very difficult to keep track of what is going on. We need to write it so it is well documented
        and each function should only do ONE task.

    > I've split the main_task() into 3 functions:
        - update
        - process
        - execute

        update(): this will read the dtmf register and fill the buffer when an interrupt is tripped.
        process(): this will process the data into different commands and return them so they can be
            passes to the transmit_avr. 
        execute(): this will send the data to the transmit_avr Arduino, where it will be processed further.

    > dtmf.cpp/h needs to be edited further.  Right now everything relies on structs from outside the .cpp file.
        This will be used for different parts of the Tardis so it needs to be self-sufficient.
